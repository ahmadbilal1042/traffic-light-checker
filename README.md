Traffic Light Checker

A simple web app that checks traffic light colors and tells users whether to stop, slow down, or go. Built with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript, it handles user input, provides visual feedback, and works both on button click and Enter key press.

Features

✅ Works with Red, Yellow, and Green traffic light inputs
✅ Displays color-coded results for easy visualization
✅ Handles invalid input with a friendly error message
✅ Clears input and focuses for the next entry
✅ Fully responsive and mobile-friendly using Bootstrap

How It Works

User enters a traffic light color (Red, Yellow, or Green) in the input field.
Clicks the Check button or presses Enter.
The app evaluates the input and displays:
Red: Stop cars (red background)
Yellow: Slow down / prepare to stop (yellow background)
Green: Go / allow movement (green background)
Invalid inputs show a friendly message with a gray background.
